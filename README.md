# EcksFinance

EcksFinance is a web application designed to help users analyze stock investments, learn about the stock market through quizzes, and make predictions about future stock returns.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed. If not, you can install it using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install all dependencies using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and run the application on `localhost:3000`, use the following command:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## Features

### 1. Welcoming Tab

The application begins with a welcoming tab, providing an introduction to EcksFinance and guiding users on how to navigate the app.

### 2. Stocks Tab

In the Stocks tab, users can input their monthly investments from the past. By selecting one of the available tickers (AEX, S&P500, MSCI All Country World Index), they can calculate the total returns they would have accumulated up to the present day.

### 3. Quiz Tab

The Quiz tab allows users to test their knowledge on stock-related questions. After completing the quiz, users can see their calculated score and compare it to others' performances on the leaderboard. Note that the current leaderboard is hardcoded for demonstration purposes.

### 4. Prediction Tab

This tab enables users to predict future stock returns and compare their predictions against a machine learning bot's predictions. This feature is designed to help users understand the potential future outcomes based on various inputs.

## Upcoming Features

In the next release, the following improvements will be made:

- **Persistent Leaderboard:** Quiz answers and predictions will be stored in a Vercel database, making the leaderboard meaningful and reflective of actual user performance.

- **API connection to get most up to date stock data:** Instead of parsing Excel Data, let's call an api (form alphaStocks for instance) to get real-time stock data!

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements!
